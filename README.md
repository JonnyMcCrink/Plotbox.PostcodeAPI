# Plotbox.PostcodeAPI

This project was created for my technical exercise as part of the interview process for [Plotbox](https://plotbox.com/)

I’d been asked to use the open source API [Postcodes.io](https://postcodes.io/) to allow a user to enter a UK postcodes so that geographical information can be displayed to them.

For this exercise I decided to code in `HTML`, `CSS` & `jQuery` in order to showcase my strong skillset in these languages.

From my past experiences, these are classed as my “bread & butter” languages, therefore to create this task, I felt these would be best suited for me to code a resolution.

An as added extra, I have displayed an interactive map on the page, which in it’s default state will show the Plotbox offices, however when a postcode is entered, this map will update to show the location of the postcode, utilising the lat and long data fields from the Postcodes.io API.

For the map, I am using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/), an open source JS library for interactive maps and used the documentation for this to help me display this type of map on the page.

I spent approximately 2hrs on this task from start to finish. I really enjoyed this task and thank you for the opportunity to showcase my skillset in this way. I look forward to hopefully chatting to you soon.
